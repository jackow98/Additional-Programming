### Program Instructions:

1. **Set Up the Parallel Arrays:**
   - Ensure the `names`, `ages`, and `colours` arrays are defined with the provided values.

```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Emma", "Frank", "Grace", "Harry", "Ivy", "Jack", "Katie", "Liam", "Mia", "Noah", "Olivia", "Peter", "Quinn", "Rachel", "Sam", "Tara", "Uma", "Victor", "Wendy", "Xavier", "Yara", "Zach", "Sophie", "Thomas", "Natalie", "Ellie", "Lucas", "Isabella", "Henry", "Amelia", "Leo", "Ella", "Oscar", "Charlotte"]
ages = [25, 30, 22, 35, 28, 40, 33, 29, 26, 31, 27, 34, 23, 36, 32, 39, 21, 38, 37, 24, 42, 45, 41, 43, 44, 46, 33, 29, 35, 26, 31, 30, 28, 36, 27, 32, 34, 23, 22, 37]
colours = ["blue", "red", "green", "yellow", "orange", "purple", "blue", "red", "green", "yellow", "orange", "purple", "blue", "red", "green", "yellow", "orange", "purple", "blue", "red", "green", "yellow", "orange", "purple", "blue", "red", "green", "yellow", "orange", "purple", "blue", "red", "green", "yellow", "orange", "purple", "blue", "red", "green", "yellow"]
```

2. **Create an Empty List for Storing Results:**
   - Initialise an empty list to store the names, ages, and favourite colours of people who fall within the specified age range (30 to 40).

3. **Loop Through the `ages` Array:**
   - Use a loop to iterate through each element in the `ages` array.
   - For each age, check if it falls within the range of 30 to 40 (inclusive).

4. **Check and Collect Matching Entries:**
   - If the age is within the specified range, collect the corresponding `name`, `age`, and `colour` from the parallel arrays.
   - Append these details to the list created in step 2.

5. **Open a Text File in Write Mode:**
   - Open a file called `people_in_age_range.txt` in write mode to store the results.

6. **Write the Collected Information to the Text File:**
   - Loop through the list of collected entries.
   - For each entry, write the `name`, `age`, and `favourite colour` to the file in a formatted manner.

7. **Close the Text File:**
   - Ensure the file is properly closed after writing all the information.
