# String manipulation:

1. **Extract the first character**
    - Given a string `name = "Michael"`, write a code snippet to print the first character of the string.

2. **Extract the first four characters**
    - Given a string `name = "Michael"`, write a code snippet to print the first four characters of the string.

3. **Extract the last four characters**
    - Given a string `name = "Michael"`, write a code snippet to print the last four characters of the string.

4. **Extract the last two characters**
    - Given a string `name = "Michael"`, write a code snippet to print the last two characters of the string.

5. **Extract characters from index 2 to 5**
    - Given a string `name = "Michael"`, write a code snippet to print characters from index 2 to 5 of the string.
