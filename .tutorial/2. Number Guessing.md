# Number Guessing Game

Write a Python program that implements a number guessing game. The program should generate a random number between 0 and 100 and ask the user to guess the number. The program should provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low and continue to prompt the user until the correct number is guessed. Once the correct number is guessed, the program should congratulate the user.
