# Python Tasks: Arrays

1. Create an array of five integers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. Print the array.

2. Given the array `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, print the first and last elements of the array.

3. Given the array `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, change the element at index 2 to 100. Print the modified array.

4. Given the array `[5, 10, 15, 20, 25]`, print all elements of the array using a loop.

5. Given the array `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`, calculate the sum of all elements. Print the result.

6. Given the array `[12, 45, 2, 9, 50, 33]`, find and print the maximum value in the array.

7. Given the array `[18, 4, 22, 9, 31, 15]`, find and print the minimum value in the array.

8. Given the array `[3, 6, 9, 12, 15]`, print the array in reverse order.

9. Given the array `[7, 14, 21, 28, 35]`, check if the array contains the number 21. Print `True` if it does, otherwise print `False`.

10. Given two arrays `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]`, concatenate them and print the resulting array.

11. Given the array `[5, 3, 8, 1, 2]`, sort the array in ascending order and print it.

12. Given the array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, check if all elements are the same. Print `True` if they are, otherwise print `False`.

13. Given the array `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, create a new array where each element is multiplied by 2. Print the new array.

14. Given the array `[8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9]`, remove the element at index 3. Print the modified array.

15. Given the array `[12, 24, 35, 24, 88, 120, 155]`, remove all occurrences of the value 24. Print the modified array.

16. Given the array `[5, 12, 7, 5, 5, 7]`, count how many times the number 5 appears in the array. Print the result.

17. Given the array `[9, 3, 6, 1, 7]`, find and print the index of the number 6.

18. Given the array `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`, find and print the sum of the even numbers in the array.

19. Given the array `[15, 22, 13, 14, 22, 45]`, find and print the indices of all occurrences of the value 22.

20. Given two parallel arrays `names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]` and `scores = [85, 92, 78]`, print each name along with its corresponding score in the format "Name: Score".

These tasks progress from basic array operations to more complex tasks involving parallel arrays, ensuring a thorough assessment and progression of students' understanding of arrays in Python.
